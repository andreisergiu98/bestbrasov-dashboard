 * @description This plugin generates TypeScript typings for `.graphql` files containing GraphQL documents, which later on can be consumed using [`graphql-tag/loader`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag#webpack-preprocessing-with-graphql-tagloader) or use `string` types if you will use the operations as raw strings, and get type-check and type-safety for your imports. This means that any time you import objects from `.graphql` files, your IDE will provide auto-complete.
 *
 * This plugin also handles `.graphql` files containing multiple GraphQL documents, and name the imports according to the operation name.
 *
 * > âš  Fragments are not generated with named imports, only as default imports, due to `graphql-tag/loader` behavior.
